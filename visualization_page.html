            This section contains four data visualizations using plotly, D3, and Altair. Each explores relationships such as:

            This interactive treemap reveals which Medications are most commonly associated with specific Medical Conditions.
        </p>
        <iframe src="treemap_shift.html" width="100%" height="600" style="border:none; border-radius: 10px;"></iframe>
        <p>
            This treemap displays the most commonly prescribed Medications for each Medical Condition. While Medications like 
            lipitor, which treats high cholesterol, appear frequently under Conditions like hypertension and diabetes, it is 
            surprising to also see it listed under cancer. Similarly, penicillin appears as the top Medication for arthritis, 
            asthma, and diabetes, despite those Conditions not being bacterial. These patterns raise important questions: Are 
            these Medications being prescribed due to underlying comorbidities, or is there a tendency toward standardized 
            treatment across patients? This visualization not only highlights treatment trends but encourages us to question 
            whether care is truly personalized or if there may be disparities in patient treatment.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Since there are similarities in top Medications per Condition, this may suggest similarities in the Conditions themselves.
            For instance, since ibuprofen and aspirin are leading Medications for asthma and obesity, this could mean that 
            they are related in some way. This would make sense, given that there is a higher possibility of developing asthma 
            for people with obesity, given how it affects their respiratory system. Additionally, the similarities in Medications 
            may suggest that the patients are developing secondary Conditions that require common Medications like penicillin,
            used for infection treatment, and ibuprofen, typical for pain treatment. However, lipitor, a cholesterol treatment,
            is the leading Medication for cancer, which is not generally used to treat cancer. This might suggest prescription bias with
            our doctors - are they pushing a Medication for brand partnernship that these patients don't need?

            This boxplot shows the Billing Amount distribution by Insurance Provider or by Medical Condition.

        <div id="boxplot"></div>

        <label for = "groupSelect">Grouping: </label>

            <option value = "Medical Condition">Medical Condition</option>

        <p>
            This visualization dislays box plots by different Medical Conditions or by Insurance Providers and the different
            Billing Amounts associated with each category option. When grouping by Medical Condition, we see a slight descent
            in the maximum billing amounts for each option, with cancer having the highest Billing Amount at $39,000 and obesity 
            having the lowest at $35,000. Obesity also holds the lowest Billing Amount with range minimum of around $2,000. The median 
            for each category is around $25,000. Per Insurance Provider, we see Aetna with the lowest range at about $3,000 and
            UniteHealthcare with the highest, about $39,000. The average Billing Amount across all Providers is again around $25,000.
        </p>   
        <br>
        <p>
            The image suggests that obesity has the highest variability in severity given that the range is so large, while cancer
            is usually a more serious Condition to treat being the most expensive with the smallest range. Exploring
            our Providers, we can assume that the average patient is insured by Aetna given their large range and lowest minimum
            Billing Amount. Their range may be pulled lower on the scale due to an increased non-emergent caseload, where they
            insure patients going in for their annual checkups. This is an option in Admission Type. UnitedHealthcare is the world's
            leading Insurance Provider, and given their higher range, this may be due to handling graver, more expensive cases.

            This interactive bar chart displays the number of patients across Age groups and Genders.
        </p>
        <iframe src="bar_plot_interactive.html" width="100%" height="1000" style="border:none; border-radius: 10px;"></iframe>
        <p>
            When looking at the overall distribution of patients across age groups, the 10-20 age group has the fewest number of patients, likely because the chronic conditions from this dataset like cancer, hypertension, arthritis, asthma, obesity, and diabetes are less common among younger individuals. 
            The 80-90 age group also has fewer patients likely due to the fact that most people might not survive long enough to reach this age range. 
            In the 20-30 age group, there is a much higher number of male patients compared to female patients, which could reflect the tendency of males to be more prone to health conditions due to riskier behaviors. 
            Filtering to look at the distribution in Duration of Stay within this age group, the trend of male patients remains consistent across different lengths of hospitalization, suggesting prolonged stay due to the severity of the health condition found in male patients. 
            On the other hand, within the 70-80 age group, female patients appear more frequently across different lengths of hospitalizations, which could reflect longer female life expectancy and a high risk for chronic conditions in women due to old age.

            This mosaic plot reveals the proportions of the number of patients with each test result based on gender.
        </p>
        <iframe src="mosaic_plot.html" width="100%" height="600" style="border:none; border-radius: 10px;"></iframe>
        <p>
            The mosaic plot provides a clear overview of the proportions of Test Results across genders. 
            One concerning observation is the large proportion of inconclusive test results which makes up a third of the hospital dataset, making it as frequent as normal results, raises questions about the reliability of hospital diagnosis for all patients. 
            Abnormal results are evenly distributed between both genders, but males tend to have more normal results, while females have more inconclusive results.
             This could suggest sampling bias, differences in healthcare access, or potential issues with diagnostic tools used in testing. 
             The higher proportion of abnormal results in females may suggest greater ambiguity in female patient health or behavior, especially since patients coming in for check-ups are receiving more abnormal results than normal ones.

            This line graph shows the patient count broken out by Medical Condition in the year 2023.
        </p>
        <iframe src="admission_trend.html" width="100%" height="600" style="border:none; border-radius: 10px;"></iframe>
        <p>
            The purpose of these trendlines are to highlight any seasonal differences in the patient counts the hospita has within each 
            Medical Condition they diagnose. It would be useful to understand any conditional patterns to give recommendations on the hospital's treatment
            plans since we'd have a better understanding of a full year's Condition rate.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            From this graph, we see consistent daily record counts of 1-2 patients per Medical Condition, with several 3-count cases of obesity and arthritis as 
            demonstrated by the dark blue and yellow lines throughout the year. Asthma appears consistently, however it peaks towards the end of December/early January,
            suggesting a correlation with the colder months. This could be due increased airway irritation and narrowing from cold air, and the various respiratory 
            viruses that occur during this time. The hospitals should remain weary of holidays as Thanksgiving time sees a spike in diabetes patient count. 
            Cancer and hypertension offer the highest patient counts in 2023, peaking at a 5-count case in May for cancer and 
            7-count case in October for hypertension. Cancer shows increased counts every quarter, which suggests a general pattern in treatment plan for these patients.
            Hypterension shows higher counts in the Summer and beginning of Fall, which is atypical for this particular Condition as blood vessel constriction is a more
            common response to lower temperatures. The hospitals should investigate these cases to ensure correct diagnoses.
