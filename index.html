    <h1>How Patient Demographics Correlate With Their Episode of Care</h1>

    <div class="section" id="introduction">
        <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
        <img src="project_intro.jpg" alt="Healthcare image" style="float: right; margin: 10px 0 10px 20px; max-width: 300px; border-radius: 10px;">
        <p>
            Research has shown that healthcare outcomes and treatment experiences can greatly vary from patient to patient based on their demographics. 
            Factors such as age, gender, and medical condition influence key aspects of a patient’s episode of care, such as length of hospital stay and test results. 
            Our work aims to analyze how patient demographics impact healthcare episodes using a Kaggle healthcare dataset. 
            Specifically, we explore whether certain age groups are associated with shorter hospital stays, whether specific medical conditions correlate with extended hospitalization, 
            and if inconclusive test results are linked to quicker discharges. By leveraging data visualization and statistical analysis, we aim to uncover patterns that could inform better healthcare decisions.

    <div class="section" id="data">
        <h2>Data Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Our dataset comes from Kaggle and originally includes 55,500 observations. 
            We filtered it down to approximately 3,000–5,000 records for manageable analysis. 
            The dataset contains information about patient demographics and their episodes of care, including attributes such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Age</li>
            <li>Gender</li>
            <li>Medical Condition</li>
            <li>Date of Admission and Discharge</li>
            <li>Test Results</li>
            <li>Medication</li>
            <li>Insurance Provider</li>
            <li>Billing Amount</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            An additional derived attribute, <strong>Duration of Stay</strong>, was calculated by subtracting the admission date from the discharge date. 
            This allowed us to analyze episode lengths in relation to other variables.

        <h2>Visualizations</h2>
        <p>
            This section will contain at least five data visualizations, including one made with Altair and one with D3. Each visualization will explore relationships such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gender vs Duration of Stay</li>
            <li>Age Group vs Episode of Care Duration</li>
            <li>Test Result Type vs Discharge Speed</li>
            <li>Preferred Medication for Each Medical Condition (Treemap)</li>
            <li>Interactive histogram for Age Group Distribution</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Interactive elements will include tooltips, filtering, and other ways to engage with the data.</p>
    
        <h3>Treemap: Medication Preference by Medical Condition</h3>

        <p>
            This interactive treemap reveals which medications are most commonly associated with specific medical conditions. 
            It highlights treatment patterns — for example, Lipitor appears frequently with hypertension and diabetes. 
            These patterns may suggest clinical preferences or opportunities for further study into medication effectiveness.

    <div class="section" id="summary">
        <h2>Summary & Future Work</h2>
        <p>
            Initial results show that specific demographics (like age and condition) have clear links to length of hospital stay and types of medications prescribed. 
            For example, Lipitor is often used in cases of hypertension and diabetes, while Aspirin appears more for cardiovascular-related conditions.
            In the future, we hope to expand the analysis by including patient outcomes and recovery data to better evaluate the effectiveness of prescribed treatments. 
            We also aim to implement demographic filters and time-based trend analysis.
