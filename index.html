    <h1>How Patient Demographics Correlate With Their Episode of Care</h1>

        <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
        <img src="project_intro.jpg" alt="Healthcare image" style="float: right; margin: 10px 0 10px 20px; max-width: 300px; border-radius: 10px;">

            Research has shown that healthcare outcomes and treatment experiences can greatly vary from patient to patient based on their demographics. 
            Factors such as age, gender, and medical condition influence key aspects of a patient’s episode of care, such as length of hospital stay and test results. 
            Our work aims to analyze how patient demographics impact healthcare episodes using a Kaggle healthcare dataset. 
            Specifically, we explore whether certain age groups are associated with shorter hospital stays, whether specific medical conditions correlate with extended hospitalization, 
            and if inconclusive test results are linked to quicker discharges. By leveraging data visualization and statistical analysis, we aim to uncover patterns that could inform better healthcare decisions.

        <h2>Data Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Our dataset comes from Kaggle and originally includes 55,500 observations. 
            We filtered it down to approximately 3,000–5,000 records for manageable analysis. 
            The dataset contains information about patient demographics and their episodes of care, including attributes such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Age</li>
            <li>Gender</li>
            <li>Medical Condition</li>
            <li>Date of Admission and Discharge</li>
            <li>Test Results</li>
            <li>Medication</li>
            <li>Insurance Provider</li>
            <li>Billing Amount</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            An additional derived attribute, <strong>Duration of Stay</strong>, was calculated by subtracting the admission date from the discharge date. 
            This allowed us to analyze episode lengths in relation to other variables.

        <h2>Summary & Future Work</h2>
        <p>
            Initially, we wanted to find bias within the patient demographics with information from their Episodes of Care.
            When looking at factors like Age, Gender, Medical Condition, Duration of Stay, and Test Results, we did not find much
            variability with our comparative analyses. We can draw from this dataset that there are no dependencies between variables.
            After exploring the data, we cannot deduce that certain Medication results in a longer Episode of Care, or a particular
            Gender is more common in a certain Medical Condition. We see that the data is very evenly spread amongst all fields.
