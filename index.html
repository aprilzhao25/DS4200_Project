        <img src="project_intro.jpg" alt="Healthcare image" style="float: right; margin: 10px 0 10px 20px; max-width: 300px; border-radius: 10px;">

            Research has shown that healthcare outcomes and treatment experiences can greatly vary from patient to patient based on their demographics. 
            Factors such as age, gender, and medical condition influence key aspects of a patient’s Episode of Care (a defined period during which a patient receives a 
            specific set of services related to a particular condition or medical event), such as length of hospital stay and test results. 
            Our work aims to analyze how patient demographics impact their Episodes of Care using a Kaggle healthcare dataset. 
            By leveraging data parsing, analysis, and visualization, we aim to uncover patterns that could inform better healthcare decisions.

            This study analyzes which factors influence variation in Medicare payments for primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA), 
            including patient demographics. The findings reveal that there is a significant difference in payment amounts across 
            hospitals, with demographics accounting for a portion of that variation. This aligns with our research on how patient 
            demographics affect healthcare episodes, particularly in relation to cost and resource allocation.

            This study examines how patient age and ethnicity correlate with hospital care quality and patient outcomes, 
            aligning with our research on demographic influence in healthcare episodes.

        <h2>Data Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Our dataset comes from <b>Kaggle</b> and originally includes 55,500 observations. 
            We filtered it down to approximately 5,000–8,000 records for manageable analysis. 
            The dataset contains information about patient demographics and their episodes of care, including attributes such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Patient Demographics Info:</b> age, gender</li>
            <li><b>Condition Info:</b> medical condition, test results, medication</li>
            <li><b>Event Info:</b> billing amount, date of admission and discharge, insurance provider, duration of stay</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            An additional derived attribute, <strong>Duration of Stay</strong>, was calculated by subtracting the admission date from the discharge date. 
            This allowed us to analyze episode lengths in relation to other variables.

        <h2>Summary & Future Work</h2>
        <p>
            Initially, we wanted to find bias within the patient demographics with information from their Episodes of Care.
            When looking at factors like Age, Gender, Duration of Stay, and Billing and Insurance information, we did not find much
            variability with our comparative analyses. However, we were still able to pull abnormalities within the patient population
            that the hospitals cared for. We can draw from this dataset that while there are little dependencies between some of the variables, the hospitals
            should take care in investigating patient population trends like thei high rate of inconclusive Test Results, the Medication 
            Perscriptions they pair with certain Conditions that may not be needed, and the concerning amount of hypertension cases in early Fall.

            This interactive, investigative site can be enhanced to dive deeper into the issues pointed out by the current visualizations.
            If there is not much variability shown between the patients themselves but rather the hospital's treatment plans and and choices, we can implement
            more visualizations comparing hospital patterns and general insights. It may be a good idea to take a look at the specific doctors and hospitals
            that are showcasing atypical patterns and to investigate possible bias and malpractice, however, more Episode of Care field details would be needed to 
            draw accurate assumptions.
