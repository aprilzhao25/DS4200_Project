Here are some of our design choices for each of our visualizations!


Treemap:
I used a treemap to show the prevalence of five drugs in various medical conditions. 
Treemaps are best suited for showcasing hierarchical relationships and proportions at a glance. 
The hierarchy is Medical Condition → Medication, with each drug assigned a distinct color. 
This allows the audience to easily see how certain drugs are used in various conditions. 
For example, Lipitor belongs to hypertension, diabetes, and cancer — a trend that may be reflective of standardization in prescribing. 
I also used a customized color palette and margin spacing to keep the visual clean and accessible.
The treemap supports meaningful interaction by letting viewers zoom into specific medication groups and hover 
over each box to view exact values. This helps reveal how certain medications span across multiple medical conditions

Bar plot:

Instead of using brush and link to explore Duration of Stay as suggested from the presentation feedback, I decided to create a separate bar chart with an interactive drop-down menu to filter by age group. 
Since I was comparing Age Group (categorical) and Duration of Stay (quantitative), interval selection didn’t work well and often caused the patient count values to go out of bounds of the y-axis. 
I also tried visualizing using box plots but found little difference between genders, so I decided a bar chart with its own filtering options would be better at highlighting distribution for Duration of Stay. 
The drop-down menu also allows easy selection of specific age groups while also being able to see the overall age distribution across all age groups as a whole. 
Additionally, I used different colors for male and female patients to explore if gender affects the relationship between the number of patients at each duration of stay. 



Mosaic plot:
I chose to create a mosaic plot to compare gender and test result types because it provides a clearer view of proportions compared to a bar chart, where counts can be more distracting for users.
A mosaic plot makes it easier to focus on relative differences between categories which is especially helpful for our dataset since most of our comparisons have little variations between comparisons.
I used different colors to represent gender in order to stay consistent with the color scheme that was used in our other visualizations.
Mosaic plot allows for highlighting subtle differences in the test result distributions relative to gender and helps viewers quickly identify differences at a glance.
