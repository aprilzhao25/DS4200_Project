Here are some of our design choices for each of our visualizations!


Treemap:
I used a treemap to show the prevalence of five drugs in various medical conditions. 
Treemaps are best suited for showcasing hierarchical relationships and proportions at a glance. 
The hierarchy is Medical Condition → Medication, with each drug assigned a distinct color. 
This allows the audience to easily see how certain drugs are used in various conditions. 
For example, Lipitor belongs to hypertension, diabetes, and cancer — a trend that may be reflective of standardization in prescribing. 
I also used a customized color palette and margin spacing to keep the visual clean and accessible.
The treemap supports meaningful interaction by letting viewers zoom into specific medication groups and hover 
over each box to view exact values. This helps reveal how certain medications span across multiple medical conditions
